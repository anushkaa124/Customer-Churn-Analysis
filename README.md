# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Customer churn, defined as the rate at which customers discontinue their service subscriptions, represents a critical challenge for telecommunications companies. With the increasing competition in the telecommunications market, retaining existing customers has become more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The ability to predict which customers are likely to churn enables companies to implement targeted retention strategies, thereby reducing revenue loss and improving customer lifetime value.
This project develops a comprehensive churn prediction system by analyzing customer behavior in telecom services, focusing on billing history, contract type, service usage, and support interactions. The methodology combines traditional statistical analysis with modern machine learning techniques to create predictive models that can identify at-risk customers with high accuracy.
